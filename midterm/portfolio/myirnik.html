                <p>"My Irnik" is a short documentary film about a father and son’s relationship and the passion of shared adventure. Set in Arctic Canada, Conor, a young father and a native of Montreal fell in love with the northern way of life and with a woman from there. Now, with a young family, he helps to pass on the native traditions and ancestral culture to his son, as he learns them himself. In this surreal landscape and isolated community, these two are bonding over a shared love of the outdoors, dogsledding, exploration and new adventures.</p>
