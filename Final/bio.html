  <p>I'm an independent creative artist based in New York. With skills ranging from sound design, video editing to producing and composing music, you will not have to look for a product team as I can be your one-man creative studio that is sure to save your time and money but still delivers quality service.

As a sound designer, I draw creativity and precision from years of multi-disciplined roles within the music industry. Within the last decade, I have worked with Israeli and international clients as a freelance composer and video editor; composing on commercials, music videos, dance performances and other media.</p>

      <p>My time as a composer and member of Israeli dance troupe Mayumana solidified my production and performance experienceâ€” an asset which has given me the foundation to build my current career. Together with Mayumana I produced and recorded original scores,
performed on stage where he held the roles of lead guitarist, drummer, bass, and beat boxer; as well as produced promotional videos for commercial use.</p>
